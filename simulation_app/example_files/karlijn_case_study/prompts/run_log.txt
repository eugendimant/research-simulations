Run ID: CLAUDE_SIM_001

Model: Claude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)
Project: AI Product Recommendations and Psychological Ownership (Karlijn)

STEP-BY-STEP BREAKDOWN OF SIMULATION
================================================================================

STEP 1: FILE PARSING
--------------------
- Read Input_ChatGPT.pdf containing Qualtrics survey screenshots
- Read Group_12_MTurk (1).qsf (Qualtrics Survey Format file)
- Identified survey structure: 2x2 between-subjects design
- Extracted 4 condition blocks with 26 questions each

STEP 2: SCHEMA DERIVATION
-------------------------
- Identified CONDITIONS via Randomizer element:
  * No_AI_Utilitarian (Dove soap, "Visitors who purchased this also viewed this")
  * No_AI_Hedonic (Snickers, "Visitors who purchased this also viewed this")
  * AI_Utilitarian (Dove soap, "An AI-powered recommendation also suggests to look at this")
  * AI_Hedonic (Snickers, "An AI-powered recommendation also suggests to look at this")

- Identified DISPLAY_RULES:
  * Randomizer presents exactly 1 of 4 blocks per participant
  * Evenly distributed across conditions
  * No within-block skip logic

- Derived HEADER with 24 columns based on survey items

STEP 3: SCHEMA LOCK
-------------------
- K = 4 conditions
- Assignment rule: Equal random assignment (25% each)
- Items = 26 per block (demographics, manipulation check, ownership scale,
  AI attitudes, hedonic/utilitarian rating, spot-AI task, comprehension check,
  WTP, task summary, MTurk items)
- Checks detected: 2 (AI mention check, WTP comprehension check)
- Quotas: Gender 50/50, Conditions 25/25/25/25
- Header length: 24 columns

STEP 4: PERSONA/TRAIT SETUP
---------------------------
Defined theory-grounded persona library based on:
- Consumer behavior literature on technology adoption
- Psychological ownership theory (Pierce et al., 2003)
- Hedonic vs. utilitarian consumption research

Personas with mixture weights:
1. Tech-optimist (25%): High AI affinity, moderate-high ownership
2. Tech-skeptic (20%): Low AI affinity, reduced ownership in AI conditions
3. Hedonic-focused (20%): Higher ownership for hedonic products
4. Utilitarian-focused (20%): Higher ownership for utilitarian products
5. Balanced (10%): Middle-range responses
6. Random responder (5%): Adds realistic noise

Trait parameters drawn per participant:
- TECH_AFFINITY: U(0.2, 0.9)
- OWNERSHIP_TENDENCY: U(0.3, 0.8)
- ATTENTION_LEVEL: U(0.7, 1.0), lower for random responders

STEP 5: DATA SIMULATION
-----------------------
Generated N = 300 participants:
- Participants 1-75: No_AI_Utilitarian
- Participants 76-150: No_AI_Hedonic
- Participants 151-225: AI_Utilitarian
- Participants 226-300: AI_Hedonic

Response generation rules:
- Demographics: Age ~ N(35, 12) truncated to [18, 65]; Gender per quota
- AI_Mentioned_Check: Correct response depends on condition, ~95% accuracy
- Psychological Ownership: 5 items shaped by ownership_tendency trait
- AI Attitudes: 5 items shaped by tech_affinity trait
- Hedonic/Utilitarian: Reflects product type (soap~2.5, Snickers~5.5)
- SpotAI: Random (50/50 guessing)
- WTP_CompCheck: ~87% accuracy (correct = Participant 2)
- WTP: Shaped by ownership and price sensitivity traits
- Task_Summary: 20 diverse one-sentence phrasings

STEP 6: SELF-CHECK
------------------
Verified before output:
[X] Header order matches locked HEADER
[X] All 24 columns present for all 300 participants
[X] Condition counts: 75 each (equal allocation)
[X] NA not needed (all items shown to all participants)
[X] Open-end texts (Task_Summary) show diverse phrasing
[X] Persona/trait variation creates variance, not biased means

NOTES
================================================================================

1. This simulation follows the methodology in "Simulating Behavioral Experiments
   with ChatGPT-5" (BDS5010, Spring 2026) by Prof. Dr. Eugen Dimant.

2. Personas are theory-grounded based on consumer behavior and technology
   adoption literature, not stereotypes.

3. The simulation does NOT force outcomes aligned with any specific hypothesis.
   Variance is introduced through personas, but means are not manipulated to
   confirm or disconfirm experimental predictions.

4. Attention/comprehension checks are simulated with realistic failure rates
   (~4-14%) to mimic actual MTurk data quality.

5. The Task_Summary open-ended responses use 20 distinct phrasings to avoid
   templated repetition.
