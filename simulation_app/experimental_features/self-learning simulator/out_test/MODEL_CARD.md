# SOCSIM Model Card (v0.11.0)

## What this run is
- game: trust
- topic: identity
- topic tags: ingroup, outgroup

## Evidence + transport
- coverage_score: None
- matched_evidence: 0
- conflicts: 0

## Reproducibility
- run_id: None
- started_at_utc: None

## Safety constraints
- Web expansion is metadata-only. No effect sizes are extracted from web text.
- Causal shifts require structured evidence units that pass schema validation.

## Limitations
- This simulator is not a guarantee of human behavior. It is a structured, auditable generator based on explicit priors and explicit evidence units.
