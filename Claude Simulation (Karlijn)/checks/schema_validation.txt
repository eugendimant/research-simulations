DISPLAY RULES / BRANCHING LOGIC
================================================================================

1. Each participant sees exactly ONE condition block (randomized)
2. Within each block, all items are displayed sequentially
3. No skip logic within blocks
4. AI_Mentioned_Check correct response depends on condition:
   - AI conditions (AI_Utilitarian, AI_Hedonic): Should answer "Yes" (1)
   - No AI conditions (No_AI_Utilitarian, No_AI_Hedonic): Should answer "No" (2)
5. Product description varies by Product Type:
   - Utilitarian conditions: "body wash" / "body soap"
   - Hedonic conditions: "chocolate bar" / "snack bar"
