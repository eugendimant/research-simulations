User: Project "AI Product Recommendations and Psychological Ownership" for BDS5010. I have
uploaded a Qualtrics .pdf and screenshots; read the attached file as authoritative.

Target population: US adults 18-65, balanced by gender.
Rows to simulate: 300.
Optional quotas: gender=50/50; condition=25/25/25/25.

================================================================================
THEORY-GROUNDED EMULATION
================================================================================

This study examines how AI-powered product recommendations affect psychological ownership
and willingness to pay, moderated by product type (hedonic vs. utilitarian). The theoretical
framework draws on:

1. Psychological Ownership Theory (Pierce et al., 2003): People develop feelings of ownership
   over targets they invest in, control, or intimately know.

2. AI Aversion/Appreciation Literature: Consumer reactions to AI vary based on task type,
   with potential aversion for hedonic/experiential domains.

3. Hedonic vs. Utilitarian Consumption: Products serving pleasure vs. practical functions
   may elicit different ownership feelings when recommended by AI.

================================================================================
PERSONA LIBRARY
================================================================================

- Tech-optimist (weight: 0.25): High AI attitudes (5-6 on scale), moderate-high psychological
  ownership, comfortable with AI recommendations, higher WTP in AI conditions.

- Tech-skeptic (weight: 0.20): Low AI attitudes (1-3 on scale), lower psychological ownership
  especially in AI conditions, prefers human/social recommendations, lower WTP in AI conditions.

- Hedonic-focused consumer (weight: 0.20): Higher ownership and WTP for hedonic products
  (Snickers), rates products as more hedonic (5-7 on scale), pleasure-seeking orientation.

- Utilitarian-focused consumer (weight: 0.20): Higher ownership and WTP for utilitarian products
  (Dove soap), rates products as more utilitarian (1-3 on scale), practical orientation.

- Balanced/neutral responder (weight: 0.10): Middle-range responses (3-4 on most scales),
  moderate variation, no strong preferences.

- Random responder (weight: 0.05): Adds noise with inconsistent patterns, may fail attention
  checks, represents inattentive participants.

MIXTURE_PRIOR: 0.25, 0.20, 0.20, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05

TRAIT PARAMETERS
================================================================================

TRAIT_PARAMS (drawn per participant, kept internal):
- TECH_AFFINITY: U(0.2, 0.9) - influences AI attitude responses
- OWNERSHIP_TENDENCY: U(0.3, 0.8) - baseline psychological ownership
- HEDONIC_PREFERENCE: U(0.3, 0.7) - preference for hedonic over utilitarian
- ATTENTION_LEVEL: U(0.7, 1.0) - probability of passing attention checks
- PRICE_SENSITIVITY: U(0.3, 0.8) - influences WTP (inverse relationship)

================================================================================
SIMULATION PARAMETERS
================================================================================

N_TOTAL: 300
RUN_ID: CLAUDE_SIM_001
CHUNK: 1

Condition Distribution (equal allocation):
- No_AI_Utilitarian: 75 participants (IDs 1-75)
- No_AI_Hedonic: 75 participants (IDs 76-150)
- AI_Utilitarian: 75 participants (IDs 151-225)
- AI_Hedonic: 75 participants (IDs 226-300)

Gender Quota: 50% Male, 48% Female, 2% Non-binary/Prefer not to say

Age Distribution: Uniform(18, 65) with realistic clustering around 25-45

================================================================================
RESPONSE GENERATION RULES
================================================================================

1. Age: Integer from 18-65, normally distributed around mean=35, SD=12, truncated

2. Gender: Categorical with quotas (1=Male: 50%, 2=Female: 48%, 3=Non-binary: 1%, 4=PNTS: 1%)

3. AI_Mentioned_Check:
   - For AI conditions (AI_Utilitarian, AI_Hedonic):
     * Attentive participants (95%): Answer "Yes" (1)
     * Inattentive (5%): Answer "No" (2)
   - For No AI conditions:
     * Attentive participants (95%): Answer "No" (2)
     * Inattentive (5%): Answer "Yes" (1)

4. Psychological Ownership (5 items):
   - Base responses shaped by OWNERSHIP_TENDENCY trait
   - Modified by condition: AI conditions may reduce ownership (based on AI aversion theory)
   - Modified by product type interaction with HEDONIC_PREFERENCE
   - Item 5 (Difficult) is reverse-coded in analysis, but simulated as-is
   - Range: 1-6, with realistic variance (SD ~1.2)

5. AI Attitudes (5 items):
   - Shaped primarily by TECH_AFFINITY trait
   - Consistent within-person (Cronbach's alpha target: 0.85+)
   - Item 5 (Threat) is reverse-coded in analysis
   - Range: 1-6

6. Hedonic_Utilitarian Rating:
   - Utilitarian products (Dove soap): Mean ~2.5 (slightly utilitarian)
   - Hedonic products (Snickers): Mean ~5.5 (slightly to mostly hedonic)
   - Modified by HEDONIC_PREFERENCE trait
   - Range: 1-7

7. SpotAI_Response: Random (50/50 Picture 1 or Picture 2) - this is a guessing task

8. WTP_CompCheck:
   - Attentive participants (90%): Answer "Participant 2" (2) - correct answer
   - Inattentive (10%): Random other answer

9. WTP (Willingness to Pay):
   - Base: Mean ~5, SD ~2.5
   - Modified by PRICE_SENSITIVITY (inverse)
   - Modified by OWNERSHIP_TENDENCY (positive)
   - May be affected by condition (hypothesis-neutral variation)
   - Range: 0-10 integer

10. Task_Summary: Diverse one-sentence summaries (see examples below)

11. MTurkID_Confirmed: 98% "Yes" (2), 2% "No" (1)
